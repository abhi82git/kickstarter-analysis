# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Background
One of Louise's plays completed its fundrasising goals pretty quickly. This made Louise think how different campaigns performed with respect to their start dates and funding goals and how many of them completed their goals. 

###Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to figure out how does the start date for a campaign afect its chances of success. Also, the analysis tries to answer the question if plays funded by a specific amount of money have greater chances of success or failure than others.

## Analysis and Challenges

###Analysis
The analysis for this problem is broken down in two parts:

1. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
2. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first part of the analyis was to figure how the starting month of a campaign influences the the success chances of a campaign.

The analysis involved creating a pivot table out of the main Kickstarter campaign to better understand how the starting month of a campaign is related to the overall success of a campaign. In order to achieve this, I created a pivot table using the following columns from the spreadsheet:
- Parent Category
- Years
- Outcomes
- Date Created Conversion

Since we are only interested in theaters, the Parent Category was selected as a filter. The Years column was also added as a filter to look at how similar months/time period in different years affected the chances of succes of a play.

The pivot table gives a concise picture of the raw data and helps to understand the effect of starting months on a campaign.

Here's what the final i[pivot table looked like.](https://github.com/abhi82git/kickstarter-analysis1/blob/512ac5d95ac33fa17a907a909a4070d575018f62/Pivot_Putcomes_Months.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
